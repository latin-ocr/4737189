This reei of microiiim contains materiei
which itas paper color changes stains, or
illustrations (some of which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure thet aii text end illustrations are
ieqibie, exposure settinqs must be changed.

therefore, when text and illustrations exist
in a single image or when materiei
becquourids differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflects the camere
operator's best effert to capture trie majority
of the text; thesecond exposure reflects the

camera operator’s best effert to capture
iliustretive materiei or the remaining text. it

is hoped that this practice wiii resuit in a
microfiirri product thet fuiiy serves the needs
